"""Agent-native memory writers — export CoBWeaverClaw memories to each agent's format.

Each writer knows how to produce memory files in the format that a specific
coding agent reads on startup. Writers handle:
- Format constraints (YAML frontmatter, heading levels, line limits)
- Token budget management (prioritize by importance × recency)
- Deduplication against existing content
- Marker-delimited sections for safe updates

Supported agents:
- Claude Code: MEMORY.md (auto-memory) + per-topic files
- Cursor: .cursor/rules/*.mdc (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Codex: AGENTS.md / ~/.codex/instructions.md
- Aider: Convention files referenced in .aider.conf.yml
- Gemini: GEMINI.md
- Generic: Plain markdown (any agent)
